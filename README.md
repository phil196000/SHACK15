- After cloning the project, setup your computer to run flutter applications by visiting the [Get Started](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) page.

  - if you chose **Download Zip**, extract the Zipped file.
- Open the cloned/extracted project in a **Code Editor**, if you do not have a code editor, I will recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Open a terminal and change directory to the project's root folder and run **_flutter pub get_**. Check image below for reference
  ![flutter pub get](./assets/readme/pub_get.png)

- If all the steps were followed, you will have the application running on an available device(Emulator or Physical Device)
